# Tokenizer Clustering

We will be using the TokenizerClass.py.

## Summary
We have implemented the store methods into database and excel and dictionary, calculation of (tf, df, tfidf), and maximum gap calculation.

## Getting Started

First, you will need Python installed onto your computer. 
Go install Python 3 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then, you will need to download the repository to your local environment. 

XAMPP will be required, or some way to connect to your localhost database. We will be looking at  
``localhost/phpymyadmin```




### Installing

You will need to install the python libraries in your command line, prompt, or bash. You can read more about installing in the following links:   
https://pythonprogramming.net/tokenizing-words-sentences-nltk-tutorial/    
https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/   
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/2.0.html

```
$ pip install ntlk
$ pip install openpyxl
```

When you're done, you can go inside the folder directory that contains this repository and type the command below to run the Tokenizer:
```
$ py TokenizerClass.py
```
A Excel Spreadsheet called 'Tokenizer_Data.xlsx' should appear in the same directory of where you executed the TokenizerClass.py file.
