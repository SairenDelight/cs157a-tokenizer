For example, functional association rules can be used to answer the following questions, where a_month and a_year are variables q  What is the percentage of people in California who buy a printer in the next month after they bought a PC x 316 Customer buy_product\(x, \221PC\222, a_ month 336 buy_product\(x, \221printer\222, a_month+1  275 area = \221California\222 q  What is the percentage of people who buy a printer within the year when they bought a PC  x 316 Customer: buy_product\(x, \221PC\222, a_ year 336 buy_product\(x, \221printer\222, a_year 275 area = \221California\222 To be distinct, we call the association rules that are not functional as instance association rules; e.g x 316 Customer: buy_product\(x,\222 PC\222, \221Jan98\222 336 buy_product\(x,\222 printer\222, \221Feb98\222  275 area =  \221California\222 Time variant, functional association rules can be derived from time variant, instance association rules through cube restructuring.
