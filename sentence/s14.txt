Then, let us consider the following functional association rule related cubes Association cube  CrossSales.3 \(product, product2, customer_group merchant, area, time_delta  Population cube  NumOfBuyers.3 \(product, customer_group, merchant area Base cube  NumOfShoppers.3 \( customer_group, merchant, area Confidence cube  Confidence.3 \(product, product2, customer_group merchant, area, time_delta Support cube  Support.3 \(product, product2, customer_group, merchant area, time_delta The association cube CrossSales.3  can be constructed from CrossSales.2   The cell values of CrossSales.2  in the selected time and time2 ranges are added to the corresponding cells of CrossSales.3 For example, the count value in cell  CrossSales.2\(<PC, Jan98>, <printer, Feb98>\205 is added to cell \(bin CrossSales.3\(PC, printer, one_month,\205 


It can also be added to cell CrossSales.3\(PC, printer one_year,\205 5  Distributed and Incremental Rule Mining There exist two ways to deal with association rules 267  Static that is, to extract a group of rules from a snapshot, or a history, of data and use "as is 267  Dynamic that is, to evolve rules from time to time using newly available data We mine association rules from an e-commerce data warehouse holding transaction data.
