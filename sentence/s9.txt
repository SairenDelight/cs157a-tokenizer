Accordingly, the cubes related to association rule mining are defined as follows Association cube  CrossSales.2 \(<product, time>, <product2, time2 customer_group, merchant, area  Population cube  NumOfBuyers.2  \(<product, time>, customer_group merchant, area Base cube  NumOfShoppers.2  \( customer_group, merchant, area Confidence cube Confidence.2 \(<product, time>, <product2, time2 customer_group, merchant, area Support  cube  Support.2  product, time>, <product2, time2 customer_group, merchant, area  The steps for generating these cubes are similar to the ones described before.
